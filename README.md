# Groqnotes: Generate organized notes from audio using Groq, Whisper, and Llama3

Groqnotes is a streamlit app that scaffolds the creation of structured lecture notes by iteratively parsing and generating notes from transcribed audio lectures using Groq's Whisper API. The app mixes Llama3-8b and Llama3-70b, utilizing the larger model for generating the notes structure and the faster of the two for creating the content.

## Quickstart

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use Groqnotes, you can use a hosted version at [groqnotes.streamlit.app](https://groqnotes.streamlit.app) or [groqnotes.replit.app](https://groqnotes.streamlit.app).
> Alternatively, you can run groqnotes locally with Streamlit using the quickstart instructions.


### Hosted on Streamlit:

To use Groqnotes, you can use the hosted version at [groqnotes.streamlit.app](https://groqnotes.streamlit.app)

### Hosted on Replit:

You can also use the hosted version on replit at [groqnotes.replit.app](https://groqnotes.streamlit.app)
> The project can be forked on replit here: [replit.com/@bklieger/groqnotes](https://replit.com/@bklieger/groqnotes)


### Run locally:

Alternative, you can run groqnotes locally with streamlit.

#### Step 1
First, you can set your Groq API key in the environment variables:

~~~
export $GROQ_API_KEY = gsk_yA...
~~~

This is an optional step that allows you to skip setting the Groq API key later in the streamlit app.

#### Step 2
Next, you can set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

~~~
python3 -m venv venv
~~~

~~~
source venv/bin/activate
~~~

~~~
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
~~~


#### Step 3
Finally, you can run the streamlit app.

~~~
python3 -m streamlit run main.py
~~~
